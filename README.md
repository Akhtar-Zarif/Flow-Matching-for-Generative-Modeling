‚ö†Ô∏è This is not the official implementation of the original paper.

This notebook centers around the **Flow Matching for Generative Modeling** article [1] and proposes an implementation of _Flow Matching_ in the case of _Optimal Transport conditional Vector Fields_. The implementation proposed in [2] was consulted and it inspired the use of the _Zuko_ [3] package for ODE solving and sampling. Moreover, this notebook adopts the notations of the original article and thus the numbers of the equations are the same as in the paper.
